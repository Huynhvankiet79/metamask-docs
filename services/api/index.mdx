# Infura API documentation

Infura is a managed service that provides secure and reliable access to a variety of blockchain networks, removing
the complexities of managing blockchain infrastructure, and allowing developers to focus on building innovative Web3
applications.

Infura serves as a crucial bridge connecting applications to blockchain networks, providing developers with robust APIs
to interact with the blockchain, deploy and manage smart contracts, and much more.
Whether you're building a decentralized application (Dapp), a crypto wallet, or an exchange, Infura provides the essential
infrastructure and tools to create high-quality, reliable Web3 applications.

## Features

Infura offers a robust set of features designed to enhance the development, deployment, and management of dapps. These features
include:

* **Broad access to major networks** - Infura supports the major networks, allowing you to take advantage of Ethereums's smart
    contracts, IPFS's distributed file system, or high performing layer 2 networks.
* **Failover support for APIs** - Currently available on select networks for customers on Growth or Custom plans; if an Infura API
    endpoint becomes unavailable for any reason, requests can be forwarded to a partner to fulfill the request.
    This ensures that your application remains up and running, providing uninterrupted service to your users.
* **Archive data querying** - [Access historical state data](./networks/ethereum/concepts/archive-data.md) at any given
    block height. This is an invaluable feature for those who need to perform deep analyses of past transactions, contract
    states, or balances. With this feature, developers can build applications that are not only data-rich but also comprehensive.
* **Expansion APIs** -
   [Access Infura's multi-chain Gas API](../api/infura-expansion-apis/gas-api/). Use the Gas API used by the MetaMask wallet to analyze and
    optimize gas costs on EIP-1559 compatible chains.
