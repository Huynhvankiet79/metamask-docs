# Get testnet ETH

Arbitrum uses ETH to confirm transactions on the Arbitrum network. To get test tokens for the Arbitrum testnet, you
first need to [use a faucet to obtain Sepolia testnet ETH](https://www.infura.io/faucet/sepolia). Then you can migrate those
tokens to the Arbitrum Testnet using the [Arbitrum bridge](https://bridge.arbitrum.io).

Refer to the [instructions to bridge testnet ETH onto Arbitrum](https://docs.arbitrum.io/getting-started-users).
