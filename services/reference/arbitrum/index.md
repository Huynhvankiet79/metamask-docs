# Arbitrum

Arbitrum is an Ethereum scaling solution that provides high throughput and low-cost smart contract execution. Arbitrum's design
allows it to be fully compatible with Ethereum. Developers will find that building with Arbitrum is nearly identical to
building on Ethereum.

Arbitrum is compatible with Ethereum's JSON-RPC API implementation, which allows using tools such as Infura, Hardhat, and
MetaMask.
